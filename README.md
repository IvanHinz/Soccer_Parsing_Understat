# Soccer_Parsing_Understat
This code was 80% based on https://www.kaggle.com/slehkyi/web-scraping-football-statistics-2014-now/notebook. 
On this website you will find a lot of useful information how to scrap football statistics, i'm very thankful to the author.
Now i'm only learning Pandas and hope that it could help some student to see the whole code here.



File with Notebook is in .ipynb_checkpoints
